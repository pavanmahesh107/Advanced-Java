Differences between StringBuilder and StringBuffer
Synchronization:

StringBuilder is not synchronized, hence not thread-safe but faster.
StringBuffer is synchronized, hence thread-safe but slower.
Performance:

StringBuilder performs better than StringBuffer in single-threaded environments due to the lack of synchronization overhead.
StringBuffer performs well in multi-threaded environments where thread safety is required.
Use Case:

Use StringBuilder when working in a single-threaded context.
Use StringBuffer when working in a multi-threaded context.
When to Use
StringBuilder: When you need a mutable string and your application is single-threaded or does not require thread safety.
StringBuffer: When you need a mutable string and your application is multi-threaded and requires thread safety.
